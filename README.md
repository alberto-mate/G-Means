# ðŸ”¢ GMeans Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the GMeans clustering algorithm, providing a robust and efficient way to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. 

The GMeans algorithm is an extension of the KMeans algorithm that automatically finds the appropriate number of clusters in the data. The splitting of clusters is done by using a hypothesis test to determine if a cluster follows a Gaussian distribution.
